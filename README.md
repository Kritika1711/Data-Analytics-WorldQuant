Worked with a dataset with 21,000 properties for sale in Brazil through the real estate website Properati.com. The goal is to determine whether sale prices are influenced more by property size or location.

Learnings in this project are:

How to organize information using basic Python data structures.
How to import data from CSV files and clean it using the pandas library.
How to create data visualizations like scatter and box plots.
How to examine the relationship between two variables using correlation.
